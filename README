This playbook will attempt to install Apache2 and transfer configuration from our existing load balancer.

For usage, just go into the Loadbalancer directory and run 'ansible-playbook loadbalancer.yml' (for debugging output, add -vvv).

This will not add an /etc/hosts file (yet) or setup iptables.

Note: No files directory has been added for security reasons.
